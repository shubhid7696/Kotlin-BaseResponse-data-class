# Kotlin-BaseResponse-data-class
This is an example of creating API response with some Base response class for common parameters
 
When I started Android development in Kotlin back in time when as a fresher I didn't know many things. So this is the example for the fresher android developers to get an idea about making data classes less complex and make better data classes while working with kotlin data classes
 
**BaseResponse** file contains common variables which will be used in most of the API responses so if there is any variable that you want to change throughout the app then it's a time saver as only one file is required to be changed.
 
So try implementing it in your projects and if you find more appropriate ways to do things then let me know so that i can update this one.
